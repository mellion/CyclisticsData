# Update- 03/21/2023
I have revisited this case study and made some significant changes. Instead of using Microsoft SQL Server, I have now utilized PostgreSQL for data management and analysis. Additionally, I have incorporated Power BI for data visualization and reporting. The repository has been updated to reflect these changes.

# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

<br>

Welcome to my Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study repository! In this case study, I will perform various real-world tasks of a data analyst. I will work for a fictional company called Cyclistic, which operates a bike-share program featuring more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.


Project Overview
The goal of this case study is to answer key business questions by following the steps of the data analysis process:

Ask: Identify the key business questions that need to be addressed.
Prepare: Collect and organize the data required for the analysis.
Process: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis.
Analyze: Explore the data, identify patterns, and draw conclusions.
Share: Present the findings to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.
Act: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
For this project, I will use Microsoft SQL Server to manage and analyze the data.
